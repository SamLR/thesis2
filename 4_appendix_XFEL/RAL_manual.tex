    % TODO differentiation between START, STOP, RESET, N/VETO as commands from ccc and states (esp in Tx)
    % TODO PORTS not signals when refering to interfaces?
    % TODO check consistant typography, use of quotes, names, use of 'word(s)' Vs 'command(s)' Vs 'cmd(s)' Vs 'instruction set'
    %      Instruction set  == the big list of words that _can_ be sent to the ASIC, from which command sequences are formed
    %      Command sequence == stream of commands sent to ASIC
    %      ASIC command     == a single 20b word sent to the ASIC
    %      CCC command      == a single 4b word received on the command line from the CCC
    %      veto command     == a single 3b word received on the veto line from the CCC
    %      word             == a generic set of bits that correspond to a command or location in memory
    % TODO note re placement of generics, i.e.\ 'generics are discussed in the section relating to the block in which they are used'
    % TODO add full (top) interface to appendix?
    % 
    The Large Pixel Detector (LPD) is being built for the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (Eu-XFEL). To maintain synchronisation between the machine and the detectors a common Clock and Control Card (CCC) is being developed. To communicate with the LPD-ASIC a Front End Electronics card (FEE) has been developed that will act as a fan out for commands and provide detector specific control.
    
    In order to control the ASIC via the CCC interface firmware was written to act as a translator unit. Translation was split into three separate sub-blocks: CCC-signal receiver, a veto filter and the ASIC command transmitter. Between the three blocks the messages from the CCC are interpreted, processed and encoded for the ASIC. 
    
    Table~\ref{tab:ccc_spec} gives the specification of the CCC interface whilst table~\ref{tab:asic_spec} is the ASIC interface. The CCC specification specifies 5 command words for the cmd and veto lines that the interface needs to interpret: \texttt{START}, \texttt{STOP}, \texttt{RESET}, \texttt{VETO} and \texttt{NO-VETO} (full specification of these are given in table~\ref{tab:ccc_commands}). Each of these command words correspond to either a single word or a sequence that must be sent to the ASIC. \texttt{START}, \texttt{STOP} and \texttt{RESET} all have multi-word sequences associated to them whilst \texttt{VETO} and \texttt{NO-VETO} are communicated with single words. The command sequences for the ASIC are specified in the LPD manual~\cite{lpd_manual}, the command words are given in appendix~\ref{cha:asic_command_words}.
